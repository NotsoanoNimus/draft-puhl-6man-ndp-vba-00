# Voucher-Based Addressing Internet Draft
This is an ***EXPERIMENTAL*** status IETF Internet Draft attempting to formalize [some research I've done](https://doi.org/10.3390/network4030016) on mitigating IPv6 neighbor spoofing techniques.

The commit history for this project actually represents the original development of my Master's Thesis idea with the University of Michigan-Dearborn.


## Draft Link
You can find the most current published I-D [here](https://xmit.xyz/).


## Extra
- It's really not that complex of a topic. In my writing I've tried to give enough information to cover everything, while also really trying not to be too verbose.
- This is my final effort with this topic, after already being largely dismissed in the IPv6 discussion list. If the 6man Working Group doesn't want to use or read this draft, then at least I can say I tried and c'est la vie.


## Updates & Process Feedback
Updates on the draft's status and/or any feedback on the IETF drafting process will be written here as needed.
